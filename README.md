1. The code fefines a loop that continually asks the user for commands until they choose to exit.
2. the available commands are:
   add. Allows the user to add an item to the the to-do list stored in a file called "lists.txt."
   show. Displays the current to-do list
   edit. Lets the user select an item from the list and change its content
   delete. Allows the user to remove an item from the list
   exit. Allows the user to exit the program

It's worth noting that this code can be improved by creating custom functions to reduce code repititoin, handling file operations more efficiently, and providing better error handling. 
Additionally, the code may have issues when thefile list.txt does not exist or when the user tries to edit or delete items that do not exist in the list
